The stream is located in two counties: Taylor and Lincoln. The stream crosses Taylor/Lincoln county line several times. According to 1980 and 2002 trout books only Taylor county part of the stream is trout Class 2. There is no mentioning of the Lincoln county part of the stream as being trout. 2002 TB map for Taylor county and 2002 trout spatial data shows the entire stream as Class 2 trout. Followed 2002 trout spatial data depiction (the entire stream is trout). This should be verified.

Headwaters cross Waupaca-Portage Co line 3 times.  NR102 lists Peterson Creek only in Waupaca Co as ORW, so technically the Portage Co portions are ERW (1980 class 1 trout).
Inna's comment:
OERW paper map shows Portage county part of the stream as ERW. Left this segment as ORW  per Mark B., who also worked on this segment. This AU crosses county line several times, so that some parts of it (in Waupaca county) are ORW and some (in Portage county) are ERW. This AU can be further segmented if necessary.",1846.17483409656

This river flows some 36 miles before emptying into the Bad River in Ashland County at Copper Falls State Park. The entire river is considered trout water, with a one-mile section near the confluence with Gehrman Creek designated exceptional resource waters for supporting a Class I trout fishery. Brook and brown trout are considered common, with an occasional rainbow trout. Brownstone Falls near the river's mouth presents a barrier to migratory fish from Lake Superior. A variety of bottom types occur in the river, from unstable sand to bedrock and rubble near the falls. Deep pool areas and long shallow riffles provide good habitat as the river passes through upland hardwood. The stream supports beaver, muskrat and migratory waterfowl. 

This river experiences variable flow rates, with low flows a problem, particularly downstream from Highway 77 where some temperatures were measured in the past in ranges close to the lethal point for trout. The river forms at the confluence of Shine Creek, which flows from Shine Lake, and the O'Brien Lake outlet.

During survey work conducted as part of the coastal wetlands evaluation two rare species of macroinvertebrate were found and overall taxa richness was moderate (5-24 species) (Epstein 1997). Iron bacteria and aquatic plants were noted at an Iron County site. Livestock, barnyards and cropland were considered pollutant threats in the Ashland County portion of the river.
